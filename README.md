# Geofencing

##This project is a location-based monitoring system that tracks the exact location of a user within a specific
area. If the user goes outside the defined geofence, they receive a notification via email alerting them of
their location change. This technology can be used for security purposes and helps to keep track of the
movements and whereabouts of individuals.
